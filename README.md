# CollabNet | Creator Collaboration Network 🇧🇩

**CollabNet helps Bangladeshi content creators earn money by collaborating with trusted local brands, using AI to create high-performing social media content faster.**

---

## The Problem

Bangladesh has millions of content creators across Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, but:

* Brand deals are hard to discover
* Payments are often opaque or unreliable
* New creators struggle to pitch, write, and plan content
* Global creator platforms do not localize for Bangladesh in language, brands, or pricing

As a result, most creators monetize inconsistently or not at all.

---

## The Solution

**CollabNet** is a creator-first collaboration platform that connects creators with paid brand campaigns, while using AI-powered tools to help them create better content and earn more.

Creators can:

* Discover verified paid campaigns
* Get AI assistance for content creation
* Track performance and earnings transparently

Brands get:

* Access to local creators
* Performance-based campaigns
* Measurable engagement results

---

## How It Works

### 1. Discover Paid Campaigns

Creators browse available brand campaigns with:

* Clear payment details
* Required content formats such as video, image, or text
* Submission deadlines and performance goals

* Write engaging captions and headlines
* Generate short video scripts
* Create relevant hashtags
* Speed up ideation and execution

### 3. Submit and Track Performance

## Why CollabNet Wins

| Alternative              | Limitation                                 |
